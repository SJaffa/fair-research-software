## Bobby the Bioinformatician
* Bobby is a postdoctoral reseacher in bioinformatics, having finished his PhD 2 years ago.
* Bobby attended a Software Carpentry workshop 3 years ago during his PhD, covering the foundatinal knowledge of Shell, Python and Git. 
* Bobby wrote a couple of Python analysis scripts during his PhD, but hasn't done much recently. He now needs to run a set of Python scripts written by another researcher who has recently left his group. The scripts are in GitHub, but Bobby does not have much experience with Git or GitHub, apart from the course he did 3 years ago, and he has never shared any of his code on Github. These scripts read data in FASTQ format and write out a set of CSV files with summary information. They may need a few minor bugs fixes and improved documentation for others to be able to more easily reuse them. 
* In addition, Bobby's favourite journal has started requesting all the raw data, scripts and computational environments used to generate the results to be submitted along with a manuscript. So this is an extra motivation for Bobby to have an up to date GitHub repository with the latest working code, data, documentation on how to run the code, results and any supporting information. 

## Gerry the Geographer
* Research assistant in human geography
* Has masters degree in geography
* Did some python modules during masters degree and wrote a few scripts for downloading and analysing data.
* She's now responsible for developing some new analysis scripts that take CSV and JSON time series georeferenced data from several online sources and performs some statistical analysis and generates some visualisations on them.
* Some of the data sources have gaps and inconsistencies and will require some cleaning first.
* A senior researcher has given Gerry some sources for the data and some example R code which does the analysis.  

## Philippa the Physicist
* Reserach fellow in particle physics
* Has a PhD in particle physics and several years of postdoc experience
* Did some Fortran modules as an undergraduate, self-taught Python programmer. 
* Has built a large set of python routines which perform a novel type of simulation on an HPC system.
* The simulation uses a JSON file to configure itself and writes out data in a custom binary format. Another set of scripts produce visualisations of these. 
* Some collaborators are asking to use Philippa's code as part of a big project, but she's the only one who understands most of it, some of the code isn't very readable, it's not under version control and has no unit tests. 

## Sam the Sociologist
* Lecturer in sociology
* Has several datasets on political groups on different social media platforms in a mix of JSON formats.
* These require some complex statistical analysis, which is proving too complex to analyse in Excel or SPSS and Sam wants to use Python instead.
* He hasn't programmed much before, did an R course many years ago but mainly uses Excel or SPSS.
* He has some funding to employ a computer science undergraduate student over the summer, but he wants to be able to direct them towards best practices for building reserach software. A colleague has told him that the code should be shared on Github, but he doesn't know how to use Github.
